    <p2 style="font-size:medium"><A HREF="Diary/diary.html">My diary</A></p2><br>
    <p3>There is probably more to this diary that what ever you are going to read or have read. i actually have a local version of this diary where i write everything so either i actually haven't written anything or i am just being lazy to make that local file into a webdiary</p3>
