so yeah after all i decided to switch to digital. and yeah it's still the same day as i wrote my last entry in my copy. yeah i know it was quick but when i thought about the advantages(i had already thought about them before) i just thought that it would be much better if i switched to digital. Gosh it feels good to type in the keybaord. and BTW(by the way(You gotta remember that ok(BTW))) there might be some typos ok. and oh oh watch this i can also do this😀😁😃😄😅😆😇😉😊😋😌😎😏😐😑😒😓😔😕😖😛😜😝😞😟😠😡😢😣😤😥😦😧😨😩😪😫😬😭😮😯😰😱 and many more. and also i can write in japanese also like this: こんにちは みんなさん げんき ですか. and also i just checked that i can also write in hindi and japanese. that's soooooooo cool right. see i told you that switching to digital was good look at how many advantages i got.<br>

yeah so it's another day huh. so yesterday there was this thing in a temple where my "elder sister" practices for a play that is going to happen in december(IDK(I don't know) the exact date) so anyway there is thing where everyone decided that everyday a different family that goes to that temple to practice(there daughters or sons) for the play had to bring food the other people going there and guess what, it was our turn yesterday so my family prepared everything and we went me and my mother went first then my "elder sister" and then my younger sister and my dad. it was fun but there a few points where it was the worst like when the sort man said all those things to me like "why don't you participate in our plays" and he also said a few more rude things or atleast i thing they are rude i mean who is he to tell me to participate in a play or not. and then there is other cocky kid who was like i mean what was his problem like his attitude was at a next level and he was looking at me with that attitude of his i mean ewwwwwwwww i hate kids like him and that's why i am never ever going to a public place like that ever again no mateer how important it is 😡. so anyways even though there ere bad things it was fun i mean i am a gerontophille and that means that i am sextually attracted to old people(and for me men mostly) and as it was a temple there were ton of sexy old men there and TBH(To be honest) i got many boners also hehe 😅️. but yeah it was fun and i think i have a crush on one of them now hehe 😅️. so enough about yesterday let's talk about today so today is the last holiday before our school opens. actually puja is going on so our schools are closed TBH i don't really like all this festivals and all i really hate these festivals. anyway i am excited to go to school again tomorrow(kinda excited) i mean it's not like i hate school it's just that i hae the kids. i wad also thinking of making a song remake in assamese for my youtube channel but i just can't get a good song to remake i've got some very good songs but i am just not skilled enough to sing them so i asked my friend for some help and he said he likes doraemon theme song hahahahahahahahahahahaha 😂😂😂😂😂😂 lol he also said he likes blue bird well blue bird is a nice song. but i already did blue bird but again it wasn't that good at that time and plus it got deleted i mean i deleted it but still hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.<br>
<H>Tuesday, 12th October</H><br>
IDK what to write today but still here i am writting again in my にっき(diary) again hehe i just thought that using japanese there would be cool hehe. so anyway it's like 2:42 AM in the morning. today i am doing a full nighter(if that's even a word) well you know the hard part about waking up till late is that you mostly fall asleep and then it's over and sometimes you hear scary sounds from the wind, insects, rats ect and they can be really scary sometimes so overall it all comes down to survival lol. so yeah i am trying to survive here all alone my whole family is asleep and only i am awake with the biggest light in the room turned on hehe and also tying on the keyboard. cooooooool hehe definately not. soooooooo now i am slowly able to do the FM(F Major) chord on the guitar it's not perfect but i am getting better and my goal is to perfect all the Major chords by Saturday cause that's when my guitar teacher will come and he hasn't come to teach for two or so classes so i pretty sure he expects to be perfect at them while all i am doing is Netflix and chill lol. yeah same day day but it's 4:27 AM now hehe still surviving. i mean TBH i do feel a little sleepy. but i am watching movie to make myself be awake and again i am writing in this dairy also sooo. today i am pretty sure that we will finish our science project for the exhibition hmmmmmmmmmm let's see how it goes. and also hope i survive this i mean if i sleep now i would definately be not able to wake up in the morning. so now there is no turning back whatsoever i mean it was too late to turn back when it was 12:30 AM soooo<br>

yep i know that i haven't been writting at all but still here i am, back again. so today was another day filled with problems and good things. we had a debate practise today, we have the semi-finals on this Saturday two days from now. it was ok my last practise session was like very bad but this one was ok. next i just had a very bad felling in my chest and i was like "ok i am finally going to die this is a heart attack" but then i was like "ok maybe i will try drinking some water" and i did and the chest pain was gone so was like "why i wanted to die" lol i guess it was just a blockage or something. and i guess you must have noticed aready that i am now also writing the time well recently our english ma'am taught us how to write a diary and so that's why i am writting the time also and again i already told yopu that i won't be writting all these "Diar Diary this" an "Diar diary that" so yeah no "diar diaries" or maybe i can put like a "Diar D" or somthing lol or mabe not right, i don't like all these things. i am alnone with my elder sister and Tommy again. and i don't have my phone so it's really boring oh yeah i forgot to tell you this but our phone was repaired althought it has some problems like a few cms of the left side of the screen doesn't work at all and also 1-2 cms from the right side also doesn't work so it's a little bit of a problem but it's alright at least i can use my phone so that's a relief. well i guess that's all that i had to say hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm. i might come again 👍️.<br>     
Friday, 25th November<br>
3:19 PM<br>
hmmmmmm getting constent lol. so anyway another day not so good not so bad. thought i a scared for tomorrow's debate compitition. but i guess whatever happens it happens for good so yeah. i litrelly don't know what to write today i mean i am alone again in the house today my little sister is also home and again no phone so i was bored so i decided to write something, anything. IDK. i guess i am going to make somthing in blender or maybe do something else like watch something or somthing. get it watch something or do something lol. ok i get it it's not funny. hmmmmmm i used to write a lot before when i stated writing this diary but on the copy and now on the computer. we had a weekly test today it was of assamese. i mean it's name is weekly test but we don't have it everyweek nowadays. but it wasn't so good i read the chapter and also a little from the grammer(we don't have a separate grammer book for assamese) but only three questions from the chapter came and that also for only one marks each and nothing came from gender the chapter i read from grammer only one question came for four marks and i got three and half on that also and the other three marks came from a question that was like "what would you do to help a person with special abilities) special abilities mean people who are retard like people having mental issues so i got only one half on that one so eight in total out of ten i mean it's fine eight is pretty good i could've gone worse but i am angry about ma'am giving things that we didn't even knew would come i mean c'mon. i was reading Doraemon's long tales again and huhhhhhhhhhhhhh just finished another volume and reading another one now. i opened blender to make something to pass some time but then i realised that what would i make so i closed it hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm it's seriosly getting boring hmmmmmmmmmmmm ☹️. hmmmmmmmmm what should i do i tried finding the phone but didn't find it so yeah that makes it worse. IDK what to do now. this diary is the only thing that is keeping me busy. i don't really like being idle i am a person who always like watching something, reading something, playing something(in the phone) or doing something else so it's times like these when i feel the worse i mean ofcourse there are worse times than this but still i don't like being idle like this. and also i am now able to type without looking at the keyboard and typing while looking at the monitor which i guess after i get perfect at i can be very fast even faster than i already am hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm lets see.<br>

4:31 PM<br>
ok so this is the second entry of the same day i mean i just wanted to add that just now i was like scared to death like literally i mean i writing a story for a anime that i wanted to make and you know i was listening to music and the song i was listening to was finished and i was like next song will come but it didn't i was like what you know i am using linux na so whenever a new media is played na a kind of a notification comes up at the top of the screen so the name of the next song came up in the top and it was kind of like glitching so i was like heh? so i opened VLC and a error was there it was the same error that comes up when you try to open a video file that does not exist or does not have any data so that kind of error came up so i was like what then i opened the folder where i keep my songs ok and i like this folder where i have all my folders that i need and use ok so i opened that folder to go to my musics folder and the moment i opened it i was like shocked i mean there was only one folder the "my productions" folder where i keep the files that are created by me you know the name already implies "production" so like i thought heh where are the other files i opened the "myh productions" folder and there was only i file the story that i was working on i was like heh what i was really scared and confused at that point then i was like "wait maybe they got deleted" so i opened the trash and i found that yes there was indeed a folder named "do not open" at the top. i was like what then i opened it and yes all my folders were there i was like i didn't delete them what happened? i was scared and confused but i was like ok whatever i will just restore them i tried it showed that it would take 5 million or so hours to get it done and it was not starting i was like seriosly scared at that point now so like i tried everything i tried restoring, copying, moving i even tried moving them one by one i also tried restarting the computer(some guest just came lol) anyway nothing was working but then i remembered that i had Timeshift and well i opened timeshift and clicked on restore and walla it worked it did take some time though but it worked and i got my files back yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. i am really happy lol. but now anyways i am done now and i should probably go and complete the story i was working on.<br>

heyyyy i am back after a like a 4 days IDK just guessed it lol. so exams are finally over and yeah that's why i am staying up so late i mean there are othe reasons but that one is one of the main ones. so ummm anyway as before today's plan and goal is to stay up the whole night now as you know i have tried this before and failed everytime but today i will do it. i don't really know what to do but once it's past 12 then we will rock lol. so umm let's see IDK what to say lol. hmmmmmm so now that exams are over we have something called a Seasonal holiday or whatever it was IDC and we like got almost a month of holiday and that's a lot i guess yayyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy. so i was like thinking what i will do all these days i mean i have like 23 or so days, TBH i am really exited to see what happenes these days(just i said that the next day god makes me go through pain lol). so like i have been writing some python code just now and i just got kinda bored so i thought let's write a entry. i am like finally finished(kind of) my project that i started when i was like 9 and i am really proud of it. you know when i was 9 i like created this really simple and crappy AI ok i mean it's can't be called a proper AI cause it didn't have any real AI like features(it still doesn't) but i am really proud of it as it finally looks good and works properly before it didn't run some functions but now after making some(a lot) changes it is finally working properl yayyyyyyy i am really happy. and look at that just when i finished typing the word 'happy' ________'s theme song started playing lol which is a happy and kinda positive vibe giving song the coincidense lol or maybe it wasn't a coinsidense maybe god is making me happy right now so that he can torture me later hmmmmmm that's very likely. well whatever IDC i have been throught enough and now i kind of have build up a habit of it now so bring it on god. just when i said that _______________ theme song starts playing which has a kind of serious starting i am telling you theses are signs. so anyway let's talk about school today, guess what there itsn't much to talk as i just forgot to say that we had science today and i wanted to say that so yeah lol. hmmmmm just made the font a little bigger i guess it's better like this maybe IDK. i got bored of programming so i am writing my storyboard again lol. and again i was bored with that also so i am writing this lol. i mean actually rather than being bored i just don't know what to type i am literally out of ideas what should i do. right now there is more than 6 hours for it to get morning and still from now it will only be 5 after 6 hours so there will still be one more hour for it to be actual morning and one more hour for it be morning for me(cause morning starts at 7 for me(as that's the time when i have to wake up to get ready for school and all the other stuff(also my body is now adjusted to wake up at 7 automatically even if i don't have a alarm clock(that's cause my inner clock or something is now synced with being wake from 7(lol))))) wow that's a lot of paranthesis lol. it 11:40 PM and i am still awake and here thought i kinda do feel sleepy まいい i guess.<br>

heyyyy i am back i was just feeling like writting something so i just opened up this diary ans started writting whatever came to my mind and i guess that is diarys are for right? anyway it's another day i said i will be consistent but well two entries one month i would not so bad right, ok who am i kidding it is bad i should be doing atleast two entries one week, and even that will be not be considered consistent right. anyway today did not start at the best as my motherforker uncle came home for some reason i don't even like calling him my uncle. i hate him he is the worst. but well there will always be people like him in the world. but what i hate is that parents talk to him with so much respect like he is some super important guy or something i mean he literally has never done anything good for us. anyway he was a motherforker, he is a motherforker, and will be a motherforker so aside from him things are fine except that my phone's recharge ended on like 28th IDK and i still haven't got it recharged why? cause no money. so things are kinda hard but i was lucky enought to download some manga like ______________ and like before ________ and i also download few episodes of this aniime i am watching nowadays ____________ and also yesterday i downloaded some episodes of this show called _________ by talking hotspot from my mother's phone. anyway i guess i will have to wait for 1st April or 3rd or 4th IDK but i know one thing that it will take time and that means i will have to live on whatever entertainment i have left with me and TBH i have already like finished though 2/4 of the whatever i had, IDK what i am going to do for the rest of the days. then again i guess i can take hotspot and download something again. you know the mangas are better cause they take a lot time time fo ryou to read and understand properly so when reading a manga chapter or a volume(i was only able to download it as chapters) it's takes a lot of my time which is good as that way i can get through the day faster as the mangas are interesting so don't really fell bored so it's all good, Atleast fo now oh and also again i have recharged the TV before my recharge was finished so sometime i can also watch the TV. So i guess i can survive or get through these days.<br>

heyyyy heyyy heyyyy look at that i am back again yayyyy(i am not really excited) so anyway i wanted to talk about school today, school is going to reopen in like two days now and as excited i am to go to school again and study and do everything else i am also scared of the new students that are gonna come to our school last year me and some of my friends saw a few students in the library sitting and giving some kind of exam probably for entering the school. and those students looked like they will be joining our school this year(of course that could be wrong) but still i am worried that hey will bully me now of course i am not like totally chickening our here but well you know getting in a fight in our chool can turn out to be bad that's why i am kinda practicing these days to get better in punching and kicking and of course i know that there are many more things to fighing that just kicking and punching but i am not an expert and i don't have a mentor so IDK but atleast i am practicing to defend my self a little bit from their kicks if they do anything. also i know that there many other things to bulling to as well like insulting you. so for that i guess i can just keep quit untill they talk about my mother or sisters but other then that i guess everything will be fine. but well keeping quit did not go too well in my last year as i reply after hearing ome of there words/sentences but this year i gotta try hard to do that. also my dad brought only two copies that also one plain one and one one sid plain one so what am i gonna do i the other periods of the first day like in hindi class, yes our new class teacher is _______ ma'am who teaches hindi but oh well what can we do about that plus it's not like i hate or don't like _______ ma'am. hmmmmmmmmmmm but anyway i guess i will be alone today my sister and my cousin sister who was staying here with us since a couple of days now will be going to our unty's house(yes that same unty whose husband i.e my uncle who i hate) and my father is at school i think and my mother is going to sivasagar for some work i guess. so i am alone yayyyyyyyyyyy and you know i have been waiting for a day like this one. and plus it's before school reopens so it's good only i guess. so i guess i will check the things and come back ok. yep everything is good.<br>
<p3>There is probably more to this diary that what ever you are going to read or have read. i actually have a local version of this diary where i write everything so either i actually haven't written anything or i am just being lazy to make that local file into a webdiary</p3>
